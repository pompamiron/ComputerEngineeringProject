# Here is some of my ComputerEngineeringProject

My senior Computer Engineering Project "Smart Cattle"

A Mobile Application for monitoring cows behaviors, predict the optimal timing for artificial insemination.
Apply Data analysis, Machine Learning and Mathematics to create the algorithm that can detect cowâ€™s behaviors.

However, I cannot show the entire of this project code because of the license.
